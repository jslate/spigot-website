    	As new and innovative as Spigottown is, you are likely to be confused by much of our content and plugins. Some of the plugins will affect you greatly and directly, so some of these tutorials should clear up much confusion. If something is still unclear, use the mail plugin to send a message to ASlate, NSlate, julimaki, or sdunphy.
